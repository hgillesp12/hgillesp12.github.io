					<p>UnityImpact is a web platform designed to improve collaboration between charities, especially smaller organisations that often face barriers to resource sharing and coordination. The platform offers three core features: a scheduling system for managing weekly events, a bulletin board for citywide updates, and an interactive map to help users easily find and engage with local activities. Built using Python and HTML, UnityImpact is deployed via GitHub Actions to Vercel. It integrates with the Charity Commission API to verify organisations and manage access, and uses a Postgres database to store information on events, bulletin posts, and registered charities. Automated tests with PyTest ensure the platform remains reliable and maintainable. Inspired by a concept from Lauren Jarvis (LSE), UnityImpact provides a scalable, user-friendly solution for strengthening the charity sector's digital infrastructure. To access, please login with the Charity Number “1110522” (The Trussell Trust) as an example or register with any valid Charity Number.<br></p>

                        Levels by Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
                        with Real-Time Deep Learning</a>
					<br>
					<p>Structured field surveys are essential for monitoring the spread of Acute Oak Decline
                        (AOD), a novel polybacterial disease affecting oak trees in the United Kingdom. Traditional 
                        methods for collecting below-canopy forest health data, such as volunteer
                        reporting or ground surveys conducted by citizen science groups, are often unstructured, 
                        manual, and time-consuming. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped
                        with commercial RGB cameras offer a more efficient approach for conducting structured, 
                        below-canopy, trunk-based surveys over challenging terrain. This study proposes a supervised 
                        learning framework to (1) distinguish oak trees from other tree
                        species in each image, and (2) assess the “risk” level of each oak tree for AOD infection. 
                        A custom one-stage object detector model, based on YOLOv5, was trained on
                        a dataset comprising both real and synthetic images. The model achieved a mean
                        average precision (mAP) of 67.4% at an Intersection-over-Union (IoU) threshold
                        of 0.5 (50%) across all classes. Notably, the model demonstrated a recall rate of
                        91.8% for the high-risk oak class, indicating a high sensitivity in detecting trees at
                        the greatest risk for AOD infection. Experiments were conducted in a simulation
                        environment at a frame rate of 13-15 FPS, and field tests were performed at the
                        National Trust's Attingham Park site. While the model shows some variability in 
                        distinguishing oak trees from non-oak trees, it aligns reasonably well with health risk
                        assessments conducted by Forest Research UK experts, demonstrating its potential
                        utility for large-scale forest health monitoring.<br></p>

					<br>
					<p>UnityImpact is a web platform designed to improve collaboration between charities, especially smaller organisations 
                        that often face barriers to resource sharing and coordination. The platform offers three core features: a scheduling 
                        system for managing weekly events, a bulletin board for citywide updates, and an interactive map to help users easily 
                        find and engage with local activities. Built using Python and HTML, UnityImpact is deployed via GitHub Actions to Vercel.
                        It integrates with the Charity Commission API to verify organisations and manage access, and uses a Postgres database to 
                        store information on events, bulletin posts, and registered charities. Automated tests with PyTest ensure the platform remains 
                        reliable and maintainable. Inspired by a concept from Lauren Jarvis (LSE), UnityImpact provides a scalable, user-friendly solution
                         for strengthening the charity sector's digital infrastructure. To access, please login with the Charity Number “1110522” 
                         (The Trussell Trust) as an example or register with any valid Charity Number.<br></p>

					<br>
					<p>eSortition is a secure digital voting platform developed with a microservices architecture. It features two Flask-based portals: 
                        the Admin Portal for managing elections and the Voting Portal for casting votes and viewing results. Key infrastructure includes
                        Digital Ocean for hosting, Railway for database management, and Azure Functions for serverless notifications. A Kong API Gateway 
                        routes traffic between client apps and backend services. Core backend microservices handle authentication, election setup, vote processing, and email notifications. The system is fully 
                        containerised with Docker and Docker Compose for consistent development and deployment.<br></p>

                        Levels by Unmanned Aerial Vehicle
                        with Real-Time Deep Learning</a>

					<p>Structured field surveys are essential for monitoring the spread of Acute Oak Decline
                        (AOD), a novel polybacterial disease affecting oak trees in the United Kingdom. Traditional 
                        methods for collecting below-canopy forest health data, such as volunteer
                        reporting or ground surveys conducted by citizen science groups, are often unstructured, 
                        manual, and time-consuming. Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) equipped
                        with commercial RGB cameras offer a more efficient approach for conducting structured, 
                        below-canopy, trunk-based surveys over challenging terrain. This study proposes a supervised 
                        learning framework to (1) distinguish oak trees from other tree
                        species in each image, and (2) assess the “risk” level of each oak tree for AOD infection. 
                        A custom one-stage object detector model, based on YOLOv5, was trained on
                        a dataset comprising both real and synthetic images. The model achieved a mean
                        average precision (mAP) of 67.4% at an Intersection-over-Union (IoU) threshold
                        of 0.5 (50%) across all classes. Notably, the model demonstrated a recall rate of
                        91.8% for the high-risk oak class, indicating a high sensitivity in detecting trees at
                        the greatest risk for AOD infection. Experiments were conducted in a simulation
                        environment at a frame rate of 13-15 FPS, and field tests were performed at the
                        National Trust's Attingham Park site. While the model shows some variability in 
                        distinguishing oak trees from non-oak trees, it aligns reasonably well with health risk
                        assessments conducted by Forest Research UK experts, demonstrating its potential
                        utility for large-scale forest health monitoring.<br></p>
